**Sophie Gibson**

This week’s feature Friday is Sophie, our Outreach and Advocacy Chair! In her position, Sophie is in charge of most Mission Mondays, as well as spearheading Spread the Word for Inclusion at Payton. Sophie has been paired with her buddy, I.S., since last year. About Best Buddies, Sophie says, “One of my favorite things about Best Buddies is definitely the relationships I’ve made in the past 2 and a half years. I’ve formed new relationships & strengthened old ones through our chapter and have had a blast doing so. Our weekly Friday meetings are such a highlight in my week.”\
