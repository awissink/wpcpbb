Did you know that some of our presidents were differently abled? Dwight D. Eisenhower had a learning disability, Abe Lincoln had depression, and James Madison had epilepsy. Others, although not born with different abilities, still contributed the the disability rights movement.

Franklin D. Roosevelt contracted polio later in life, which caused him to lose the use of his legs. He founded the March of Dimes program, which researches treatments and prevention of birth defects and infant mortality. He also purchased the Warm Springs resort and turned it into the Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation. After his death, disability advocates lobbied for his FDR Memorial Commission to include a statue of the former president in his wheelchair, increasing visibility for people who use wheelchairs. And did you know that President John F. Kennedy was the brother of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founder of Special Olympics, and uncle to Anthony Kennedy Shriver, founder of Best Buddies??

In terms of federal laws, many consider Section 504, IDEA, and ADA to be the most influential. These were originally passed under Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and George H.W. Bush, respectively. Although presidential change is pretty cool, remember that grassroots change can be just as influential! How can you further abilities for people with IDD in your community?
