**Dos**
- Remain at eye level with the person you are speaking to. Sitting is a respectful alternative to bending down while in conversation.
- Ask mindful questions.
- Ask if the person using a wheelchair would like help if appropriate, but understand that people have their own ways of doing things.
- Remain cognizant of surroundings when planning events. This includes informing those who use wheelchairs about when an environment may not be wheelchair friendly, and making sure appropriate accommodations are made if need be.
- Be aware of how you’ve placed yourself and your belongings in a space. Is there plenty of room for someone to easily get through?

**Don’ts**
- Don’t make assumptions. Whether about why someone is using a wheelchair or if they want you to move their chair, try not to make or act on assumptions.
- Don’t move (or touch) someone’s wheelchair without their permission. This includes placing or hanging your belongings from their chair. And don’t sit in someone’s wheelchair if they’re not in it, unless they give you express permission.
- Don’t stand or bend over someone who is in a wheelchair. Doing so can be seen as patronizing.
