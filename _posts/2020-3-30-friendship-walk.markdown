As you may know, the Chicago Friendship Walk was scheduled for April 18, 2020. However, due to safety concerns from the Coronavirus, the walk has both been pushed back and moved online. On June 20, 2020, Chicago will have a virtual friendship walk. More information on the platform, etc. will be released soon, but we still have our goal of 50 team members each raising at least $50, with an overall team goal of $3,000… and we’ve already raised $2,065! Now more then ever, BBIL needs our support, so please consider joining our team and donating [here](https://www.bestbuddiesfriendshipwalk.org/chicago/supporting/#wpcpbb).
