**Nate & KJ**

Nate and KJ were our November buddy pair of the month! KJ was very excited to eat a yummy lunch of Domino’s pizza, Parmesan bites and chocolate lava cakes with Nate in room 146, and Nate had this to say about their friendship:

“Me and KJ have a great friendship. We enjoy being around each other.  I like being paired with KJ because he always has a smile on his face and is very energetic. He makes Best Buddies the best part of my day no matter what.“

What a great pair! It’s clear that the reason they were nominated — building a close friendship quickly and always having fun — holds true! Can’t wait to see what these boys do next!
