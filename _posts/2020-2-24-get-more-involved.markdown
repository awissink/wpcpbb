We meet every Friday for Best Buddies, but did you know there’s even more ways to get involved?
- **Join our Friendship Walk team:** Looking for a way to raise money for BBIL to spread the Best Buddies love around the state? Look no further than the friendship walk! You can join our team here: https://www.bestbuddiesfriendshipwalk.org/chicago/supporting/#wpcpbb  Our goal this year is 50 members that each raise at least $50 (enough to get a t-shirt!) so join and invite your friends! The walk is Saturday, April 18 from 9 am to 1 pm at Soldier Field.
- **Help our Friend-A-Thon:** Already on the team, or unable to participate, but still want to help fundraise? Join us after school on Friday, March 6 for a Friend-a-Thon fundraiser with BBIL and Latin! Reach out to Lucy (lzises@cps.edu) for more information.
- **Volunteer as a Best Buddies Ambassador Speech Coach:** Soon, Best Buddies WPCP will be hosting a speech training for our buddies to become BB Ambassadors! Speech coaches help write speeches and work on public speaking skills with the buddies. More info coming soon!
- **Volunteer at the ChiTown Half Marathon:** Best Buddies is the charity receiving the proceeds from this year’s ChiTown Half Marathon and 10K. The race is on April 4—learn more here: https://allcommunityevents.com/chitownhalfmarathon10k
- **Participate in the Polar Plunge:** This is **technically** not for Best Buddies, but we do have a team: this year, the Polar Plunge benefits Special Olympics and Special Children’s Charities. Join Payton Best Buddies’ Team here: https://secure.qgiv.com/event/team/857160/

And as always, remember to come to prom prep enrichments on Mondays and Thursdays!
