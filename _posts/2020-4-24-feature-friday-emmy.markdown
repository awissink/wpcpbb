**Emmy Smith**

This week’s Feature Friday is our Secretary, Emmy. This is Emmy’s second year on the board; last year, as a junior, she held the role of Friendship Walk Coordinator. Of her position, Emmy says, “As secretary, some of my responsibilities include taking notes at board/ chapter meetings and making sure everyone gets their friendship updates in.  Of course, like every member of the board, I am responsible for planning enrichments when it’s my turn. My job is a lot of fun because I get to interact with all of the peers in the club for friendship updates, as well as participate in our enrichments every week!” We can’t wait to see what she’ll do next year at UNC!
