With a new month comes new awareness campaigns. For October, the 75th National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM) is in full swing! We will be taking a short break from disability awareness training as we learn about all things employment for those with disabilities. This week, we will go over the basics of disability employment awareness month, and cover more specifics in the next couple of weeks.

Firstly, a bit of history. The first instance of recognizing and supporting individuals with disabilities in the workplace occurred in 1945, when Congress designated a week for employing those with physical disabilities. However, not all disabilities are physical, and in order to make a more inclusive campaign, the word “physical” was removed in the 1960s. Eventually, the week was extended to a month for awareness, and named National Disability Employment Awareness Month, recognized each October.

Each year, the month has a theme, with this year’s being Increasing Access and Opportunity. While NDEAM is led each year by the U.S Department of Labor’s Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP), the observances of the month vary. That being said, some common things that are done to recognize the month include leadership training sessions, the evaluation of disability hiring efforts, media campaigns and events, the distribution of posters and other resources, and attending local events.

Next week, join us as we look at specific organizations and employers that are working to support inclusion in the workforce!
