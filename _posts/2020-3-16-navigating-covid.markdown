With Payton shutting down completely at 5 pm tonight, you may be wondering what that means for you and your buddy. Obviously but unfortunately, we will not be having our regularly scheduled enrichments, and will most likely not be able to have our March outing. It can be hard to maintain any friendship during a 2-week separation, so let’s look at some strategies to keep our BB friendships thriving through this rough time.  

- Phone communication! Does your buddy have a phone? If so, do you have their phone number? If not, try sending a note home with them with your phone number, asking their parent to reach out and potentially let you use their phone as means of communication during this time. You can text, FaceTime (Group FaceTime 2:30-3:30pm on Friday, anyone? :)), and call one another. This is a great way to stay in contact and keep each other updated on what’s going on in your lives.  
- Social media! Do you and your buddy follow each other on Instagram, have each other on Snapchat, or are Facebook friends? If so, this is a super fun way to stay in touch during the upcoming two weeks. DM and send memes on Instagram, and keep up with each other’s Facebook status updates. Have a POD you love to spend time with? Consider making a group story that everyone can add to to entertain each other with different ~quarantine hacks~ and funny stories. Or just play filter games together!  
- Email! Does your buddy not have a phone or any social media accounts? No problem—everyone’s CPS emails will remain open, meaning you can not only email one another, but FaceTime over gChat as well!  
- Mail! A little old fashioned, but with two weeks, there’s plenty of time for a letter or package to travel from one part of the city to another. Stop by 146 and get their address, then write each other letters! (IF you are not sick, as the disease can last on some surfaces for up to 3-4 days). If you’re worried about spreading the virus through your mail, you can also directly deliver a package via Amazon.  
- Journal! If your buddy doesn’t seem super interested in any of these forms of communication, ask them to keep a journal or vlog about their experiences over the two weeks, and keep one yourself. Then, when we get back to school, trade and see what everyone was up to!  

Overall, the most important thing is staying safe and healthy. Even if you are not personally at risk, please socially distance yourself in order to keep the members of our community—many of our buddies included—who fall in to at-risk categories. We can’t wait to see you in a few weeks!
