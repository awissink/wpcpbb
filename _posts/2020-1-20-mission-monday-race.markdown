The most widely discussed problem with race and special education is “Significant Disproportionality” in diagnosis rates between white students and students of color. Significant Disproportionality is when a school district tends to identify students from one racial or ethnic group as having IDD at markedly higher rates than other kids. This commonly effects non-white students, and the IDD categories diagnosed tend to be “subjective,” such as emotional behavioral, speech and language impairment, and autism, as opposed to “hard” disability categories, which come with a medical diagnosis, such as deafness or visually impaired.  
The problem with this isn’t that students are getting help; it’s that the high rates of disparity indicate that students are being falsely diagnosed. Once diagnosed, or potentially misdiagnosed, systematic racism means that students of color are more likely to be separated from GenEd classrooms and/or put on Certificate of Completion, as opposed to diploma, tracks. This can lead to reduced higher education and job opportunities later on, as well as increased social isolation.
Certainly, the purpose of this blog is not to encourage reducing access to special education resources for students of color, or the ban of pod classrooms for those who benefit from that style of learning. Rather, this should serve as a reminder that systematic racism pervades nearly every American institution, and awareness of that is a key step to fighting for equality of people with IDD everywhere.
