Welcome to our first feature of National Disability Awareness Month (NDEAM)! This week, read on to learn about Bitty and Beau’s a coffee shop working to spread inclusion in the workplace. Originally called Beau’s Coffee, the shop first opened up by Amy Wright and her family in 2016, and sought to advocate for the “value, inclusion, and acceptance of those with intellectual and developmental disabilities,” doing so as it was run by 19 people with IDD. Amy Wright, the founder, wanted a way to honor and support her two youngest children, both of whom have Down syndrome. As of now, Bitty and Beau’s has expanded to 5 locations across 4 different states, and employs 120 people with disabilities. Every few weeks, the company features several team members and brief interviews on what they enjoy about working. With over 80% of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities unemployed, places like Bitty and Beau’s are working to close that gap, as they place an emphasis on hiring those in underrepresented groups.

If you want to support the company, check out their shop section, where you can purchase coffee beans, apparel, dining ware, and more! Additionally, check back in the coming weeks to read about other organizations and companies like Bitty and Beau’s that push for inclusion every day.
