Yesterday, March 21, marked World Down Syndrome Day (WDSD)! Celebrated globally, this day is dedicated to raising awareness about Down syndrome and for people living with this genetic condition. People around the world come together to advocate and make sure that people with down syndrome have the same opportunities as everyone else. According to Down Syndrome International, “The date for WDSD was chosen to signify the triplication of the 21st chromosome which causes Down syndrome.” The first celebration of WDSD was in 2006, but it wasn’t until 2011 when Brazil asked the United Nations to put it on the national calendar.

In order to celebrate WDSD, it is important to know what Down syndrome is. Also from Down Syndrome International, they define Down syndrome as, “A naturally occurring chromosomal arrangement that has always been a part of the human condition, being universally present across racial, gender or socioeconomic lines in approximately 1 in 800 live births, although there is considerable variation worldwide.” Having Down syndrome does not mean that your life is restricted. People with Down syndrome go to work, go to college, drive, own businesses, and do many other amazing things on a day to day basis.

Down syndrome should not be portrayed as a sad diagnosis. Instead, it should be celebrated and embraced and WDSD does exactly this. Mary Borman, a Down Syndrome Ambassador, loves WDSD because, “It gives me a chance to show everyone what I can do, accomplish and how I have succeeded in life thus far. Although WDSD celebrates and advocates for people with Down syndrome, it is only one day of the year. What WDSD accomplishes in one day should be our mission every day of our lives.
