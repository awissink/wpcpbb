You may have seen our Special Olympics athletes practicing in the gym during seminars or hopping on the bus to go to games, but did you know you don’t need to be a Best Buddies member to play unified? You also don’t need to be a savant at all sports! If you have a passion for teamwork and basic knowledge/skills at any particular sport, reach out to any member of our Special Olympics Committee (Niko Vasilopulous, Benjamin Wilen, Natalie Rosenbaum, Drew Heinig, Olivia Moore and Aidan Bradley) to see if the team is in season! Right now, many of our buddies are working on track skills for this upcoming Spring.
