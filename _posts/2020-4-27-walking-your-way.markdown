A few months ago, Anthony Kennedy Shriver issued a challenge to all Best Buddies programs to show off their virtual friendship walk and mission of inclusion with the hashtag #tiktokwhileyouwalk. Inspired by other chapter’s fun virtual walks and dances, Harper and Lucy have decided to take it one step further by walking a marathon around Chicago to raise money for BBIL! They have created a route that hits as many club member’s houses as possible, which you can see [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/drive?state=%7B%22ids%22%3A%5B%221v3zYUKT2eGvAKSzZr64mgU6Vqm1EpL6m%22%5D%2C%22action%22%3A%22open%22%2C%22userId%22%3A%22118284796570718171566%22%7D&usp=sharing).
Please consider pledging and asking friends and family to donate to Payton’s Friendship Walk team [here](https://www.bestbuddiesfriendshipwalk.org/chicago/supporting/#wpcpbb). Best Buddies Illinois needs us now more than ever!
