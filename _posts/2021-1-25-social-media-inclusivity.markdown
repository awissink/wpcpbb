Social media is used by so many, and itâ€™s important to make sure everything posted is accessible to people with IDD as well. Some quick tips to making your social media more inclusive are:
- including closed captioning on videos
- writing hashtags in camelcase
- using contrasting text colors
- choosing easy-to-read fonts and make text large enough to be easily read
- including descriptive image captions

Little things like this make it so everyone, regardless of ability, can use and enjoy social media!
