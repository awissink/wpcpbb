**Lucy Zises**

This week’s Feature Friday is Lucy, our Major Events Coordinator! This is Lucy’s first year on the Exec board, and she’s done an amazing job. In fact, she’ll be taking over as Chapter President next year. About her role, Lucy says, “I love being Major Events Coordinator because it allows me to make sure our buddies, peers, and associates have the best prom, Friendship Walk, holiday parties, and enrichments possible!” We can’t wait to see you run the club next year, Lucy!
