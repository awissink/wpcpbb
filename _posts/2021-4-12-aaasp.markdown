We already know a lot about Special Olympics, the organization that provides training and competition opportunities for persons with intellectual disabilities. So, this week we are going to be taking a look at The American Association of Adapted Sports Programs. AAASP’s mission is “to develop and support a standardized structure for school-based athletic competition to improve the well being of students with physical disabilities."

AAASP was founded in Atlanta after the 1996 Paralympic Games and two decades later, AAASP programs are the most successful examples of competitive, interscholastic adapted sports. To date they have hosted over 1700 competitions with over 5600 participants over the lifetime of the program.

AAASP has created “the essential elements school districts need to successfully offer adapted teams sports for students with disabilities”, developing: Wheelchair Handball, Wheelchair Basketball, Wheelchair Football, Wheelchair Track & Field.
These adapted athletic programs create opportunities for student athletes with physical disabilities to achieve lasting friendships, learn fundamental skills such as teamwork and strategy, all while having high expectations and clear standards for success, which relate back to the students performance in the classroom just as school athletic programs do for non-disabled students.
