We’ve all seen the TikToks and we’ve all heard the jokes that claim Helen Keller never existed. And if she did, there was “no way” she was both blind and deaf. Invalidating Helen Keller’s accomplishments because of her disability is actually not funny, but instead really ableist and really harmful.

Helen Keller was born in 1880 and became DeafBlind shortly before she turned 2 years old. As a kid, Keller primarily used sign language to communicate. When she was 7, her mother hired Anne Sullivan as a tutor, who eventually taught Helen how to speak, read, write, and even understand people using the Tadoma method (more information linked below). Keller attended Harvard University, became the first DeafBlind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree, wrote 14 books (including her famous autobiography, countless speeches, and essays on a variety of topics), became a part of social justice movements, and did much more during her lifetime.

People on TikTok have begun to doubt Keller’s accomplishments, and sometimes her whole existence, for no other reason than her disability. These false claims and diminishment of Keller reinforce the ableist expectations society has for what disabled people can accomplish. They encourage the untrue idea that people with disabilities, such as blindness or deafness, cannot be well-educated and intelligent. Had Helen Keller been someone without an IDD, would her accomplishments and existence be in question? No. As said in [this article](https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/helen-keller-conspiracy-theories-ableism), “The perception that non-disabled people have of disabled people’s abilities can lead to the erasure of disability in some instances, which undermines the impact disability has on people’s lives.”

Helen Keller is not the first, not the only, and definitely not the last person whose accomplishments have been questioned because of their IDD. Instead of brushing it off as satire or a joke, make sure to understand the harmful and ableist nature of such claims.
