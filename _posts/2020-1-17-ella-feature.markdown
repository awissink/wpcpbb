**Ella Weishuber**

This week’s feature Friday is Ella Weishuber! Ella is the Pod leader of Pretty PLEEZ Peas, and was nominated for her focus on group unity and making sure everyone feels involved and included. Says Ella, “I love best buddies because I have been able to make amazing friendships through fun activities in and out of school. The buddies always brighten my day and make school so much better. Thank you best buddies!!!” We can’t wait to see what Ella and her POD do next!
