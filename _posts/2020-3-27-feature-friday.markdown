This week’s feature Friday is everyone who joined us for our first virtual enrichment! For our meeting, we played custom Jeopardy, with categories like “Best Buddies Walter Payton,” “All About Harper,” and “Coronavirus,” to name a few. Congrats to team Penguin on the win! We will be having enrichments weekly via zoom—check your email for the links to join!
