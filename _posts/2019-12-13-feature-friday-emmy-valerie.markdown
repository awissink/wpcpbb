**Emmy & Valerie**

Emmy and Valerie have been matched since Sophomore year, and love to spend time together in and out of club meetings. This year, they have especially enjoyed getting to text and talk on the phone, a highlight of the day for both of them. Says Emmy, “I like Best Buddies because of the friendships and the fun activities i’ve been able to experience in the club. it’s always the best way to end my weeks!” Valerie says, “I like best buddies because it allows us to meet new people, be more open minded, and gives us opportunities that we can benefit from. Also, it gives us Payton students a time to focus on our social life rather than always worrying about grades or anything around there.”
