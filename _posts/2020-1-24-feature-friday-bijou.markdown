**Bijou**

This week’s feature Friday is Bijou, Ms. Spencer’s dog. Bijou is a licensed therapy dog who spends her days in 146, being cute and working on learning how to use buttons to signal that she needs to go outside. If you’re interested in spending some time with Bij, stop by 146 and see if you can take her for a walk or sign up for a “Time with the Therapy Dog” enrichment!
