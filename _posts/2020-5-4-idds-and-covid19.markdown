With people all over the world, from a variety of backgrounds, living through the COVID-19 pandemic, there are few who have not been impacted by the current global situation. And while most everyone has felt the impact of COVID-19 in some way, there are some groups who are at a higher risk of having life drastically altered, including those with developmental and intellectual disabilities (IDDs). 

As noted by the CDC, “Disability alone may not be related to higher risk for getting COVID-19 or having severe illness. Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.” That being said, some people with IDDs may be at higher risk for infection or severe illness due to underlying health conditions. Since those with IDDs are “ 4 times more likely to report their health to be fair or poor than people with no disabilities (40.3% vs 9.9%),” findings by universities such as Syracuse University are further corroborated. These findings indicate that:

- COVID-19 deaths will likely be more prevalent among those with intellectual and developmental disability (IDD).

- Death rates from pneumonia are between 2.2 times and 5.8 times higher among individuals with an IDD than among those without IDD, giving us a clear warning of the severity of COVID-19 among people with IDD.

- Underestimation of COVID-19 deaths is potentially more severe for those with IDD

Unfortunately, the impact of COVID on those with IDDs doesn’t just stop at increased severity rates. As stated by the CDC, “People who have limited mobility or who cannot avoid coming into close contact with others who may be infected, such as direct support providers and family members, People who have trouble understanding information or practicing preventive measures, such as hand washing and social distancing, and People who may not be able to communicate symptoms of illness, [are all at an increased risk of infection].”  Even those who are never exposed to or do not contract the virus can still have life significantly altered. Many people who live with IDDs depend on services relating to home, community, education, and employment that have been restricted or completely canceled due to the pandemic. Countless adults and children benefit from one on one special education support in a classroom, speech, occupational, or visual therapies, mobility support, and community outreach centers. As stated, “Continuity of operations for services and supplies that assist people with disabilities and older adults is critical for ensuring individuals maintain their health, safety, dignity and independence.” With that being said, it is important for governments to find alternatives to services that are unable to function within  social distancing guidelines. Additionally, information provided by governments involving COVID-19 and appropriate responses “must be available in accessible formats, including sign language, video captioning, the use of alternative text in images and graphics displayed digitally, and easy-to-read versions.”
