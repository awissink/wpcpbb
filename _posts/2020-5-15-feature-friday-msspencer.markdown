**Ms. Spencer**

This week’s Feature Friday is Ms. Spencer, our amazing club sponsor and head teacher in Room 146. In addition to helping us run enrichments, supporting pairs, leading Special Olympics activities, chaperoning field trips and communicating with Best Buddies Illinois, Ms. Spencer is a constant source of support and encouragement for the board and all members of the club. It truly could not run without her. About Best Buddies, Ms. Spencer says, “Best Buddies is great because it gives so much joy to everyone involved. Personally I love to mentor the club because I see the friendships in action. I hear the laughs and witness the smiles. It makes me feel so happy because I know these bonds of friendship are genuine.  They are equally important to the matches and members. Being a friend to someone is such a gift. Everyone needs friends. Especially in a time when friends can’t physically hangout together. Our club and the connections it creates provides the much needed mental wellness and stability we all crave. I’m so thankful to have dedication of our leaders and members who make this happen. If someone where to ask me my most favorite part of my teaching life I’d have to respond Best Buddies.  No matter what kind of day you’ve had when friends come together in Best Buddies they manifest such joy you can’t help but be your best self.” Thank you Ms. Spencer!
