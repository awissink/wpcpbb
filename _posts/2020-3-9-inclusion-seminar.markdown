This week’s freshman lesson plan is on Inclusion, but if you’re a Sophomore, Junior, or Senior looking to learn more, check out this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bEFXBTvETadrfs4TGruNg7ju9TidZLFR/view) (the first half featured at the pep rally!) and some reflection questions!

Questions:
- “What are some takeaways from the video?”
- “How have you seen inclusion here at Payton?”
- “How can we include more in our everyday lives?”
- One common IDD not discussed in the video is ASD, or autism spectrum disorder. People with autism can be hyper-sensitive to stimuli, such as sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touch. This makes it easy for a sensory overload to occur. Think: if you were to make a video segment about etiquette for people with ASD (being respectful sensory overloads or anything else you may know about autism) what actions would you suggest students take to be mindful of peers with autism?
