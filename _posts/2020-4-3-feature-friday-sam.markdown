**Sam Brody**

This week’s feature Friday is our treasurer, Sam Brody. The duties of the treasurer include getting tax exemption forms, collecting receipts, and helping organize fundraisers. Of being treasurer, Sam says, “As treasurer, I fill out reimbursement forms, organize fundraising logistics, and apply for club grants. My job is a lot of fun because I get to achieve our chapter’s mission while still getting to participate in club activities each week!” If you’re interested in this role for next year, apply online at bestbuddiesonline.org !
