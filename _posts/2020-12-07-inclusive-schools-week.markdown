As a continuation of National Special Education Day and our mission of inclusion, we’ll be learning about National Inclusive Schools Week (ISW)! Each year during the first full week of December, schools, organizations, and individuals celebrate steps toward inclusive education. Sponsored by the Inclusive Schools Network (ISN), “ISW was created to commemorate the progress that schools have made in providing a quality education to an increasingly diverse student population including students who are marginalized due to disability, gender, socio-economics status, cultural heritage language preference and other factors. ISW also provides an important opportunity for educators, students and parents to discuss what else needs to be done to ensure that their schools continue to improve their ability to successfully educate all children.” While the week is not centered around special education itself, it draws attention to making education accessible for any student, regardless of any factor, including disability.

To get into some context, Inclusive Schools Week was initially developed using a grant from the US department of Education’s Office of Special Education programs. Through the years ISW has expanded not only in the scope of its mission, but in areas impacted; schools from different districts, cities, states, and even countries have found ways to bring students, teachers, parents, and administrators together to meet educational needs of every learner.

This year, schools across the world, from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Atlanta in the US have shared the ways in which they are celebrating and spreading Inclusive Schools Week. Ranging from video productions, book readings, and speeches, various educational systems are doing what they can, even during a pandemic.

In the future, those involved in ISW hope to “continue to grow each year in terms of the breadth and depth of its outreach efforts, content coverage, participation, and media response.” While there is still much to do in order to progress diverse education, especially in a pandemic, celebrating the wins and acknowledging the flaws in educational systems is a great way to start. The best way to begin your involvement includes checking out the website and learning more. Happy National Inclusive Schools Week!!
