**What is person-first language?**

To use people-first language is to refer to someone with IDD (intellectual or developmental disability) as a “person with [different ability],” instead of “[different ability] person,” the most common example being a, “person with autism,” instead of an “autistic person.” The argument for people-first language is that because having an IDD is just one element of their identity, it should not come before the fact that they are human. This is how Best Buddies advocates for talking about people with special abilities—you can watch their video explaining it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPft0oW6MB0), starting at 0:47. 

**What is identity-first language?**

Identity-first language is newer, and has gained popularity in the autism community. This is because often, having autism (or any IDD) is an integral  part of a person’s identity, not just something that they “have” or something “with” them. In short, you can’t have the person without the autism, just as you couldn’t have someone without their race or religion and still see their whole identity. The ASAN (Autism Self-Advocacy Network) has an article explaining more of this viewpoint [here](https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/identity-first-language/).

**So, which should I use?**

The reason person-first language came about was to consciously move away from the long and complex history of people with IDD being defined and minimized by the fact that they had special abilities, and it’s important to remember that this is still a problem faced by many people with IDD today. Making an effort to use language that reinforces that everyone, with or without IDD are people first and foremost is erring on the side of respect, and that’s what we aim to do in all situations at Payton. However, it’s also respectful to listen to how people with IDD refer to themselves, and use identity-first language if they demonstrate that’s what they prefer, validating the fact that special abilities are a large part of their identity.
