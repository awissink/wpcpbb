Thank you so much to everyone who supported, shared, and liked our entry for the Best Buddies #EmpowerInclusion Challenge! Our video currently has over 3.4k likes, and we can't express our gratitude enough. Club members, please look out for information about t-shirts and meeting with Anthony K. Shriver soon!

Wednesday, March 3rd is Spread the Word Day! Please engage in our long advisory lesson, and sign the [Pledge for Inclusion](https://www.spreadtheword.global/pledge).

This Friday, March 5th, we will do the Polar Plunge during enrichment! Please check your emails for more information about the schedule of events, plunging options, and more.
