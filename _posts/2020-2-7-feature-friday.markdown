**Olivia Moore**

This week’s Feature Friday is POD leader Olivia Moore. Olivia leads the Gloria POD, and she says, “I love BB because it gives me a chance to meet new people and contribute to an environment where everyone is accepted. Through being a leader in BB I love being able to help people see how our best buddies are wonderful people and are just like us.”
