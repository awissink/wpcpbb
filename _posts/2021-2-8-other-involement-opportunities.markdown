Did you know that there are many opportunities outside of our weekly enrichments to engage with Best Buddies?
- Every Tuesday, Best Buddies Illinois holds free virtual events open to anyone
- Every Wednesday Best Buddies New Hampshire holds free virtual Zumba open to anyone
- The bbil_friendships page on Instagram regularly posts disability advocacy and awareness information.

We also have the Polar Plunge and Friendship Walk coming up soon, so make sure youâ€™re registered. Feel free to email us or reach out to a board member for more information about any these events!
