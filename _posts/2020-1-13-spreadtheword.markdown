This week, we are learning more about the new Spread the Word Campaign, which is a joint effort by Best Buddies and Special Olympics. In years past, we have promoted Spread the Word to End the Word. This campaign encouraged ending the use of the “r-word,” one person at a time. Of course, we still  are working to end the use of the r-word in our Payton community and the world as a whole. However, we also know that avoiding exclusive language is just the first step. As individuals and as a community, we should strive to be actively inclusive, which is why this new campaign focuses on Spreading the Word for Inclusion! You can take the pledge to Spread the Word [here](https://www.spreadtheword.global/).
