Have you ever passed a note? Made a face at your friend when taking a hard test? Tried your hand at sign language? Then you’ve used augmentative/alternative communication, which is any communication that is nonverbal.

Today, we’re talking about aided AAC, which is communication that requires some device other than a person’s own body. For example, writing with a pen and paper is aided, but using sign language is unaided.

Low-tech aided AAC communication devices include boards with preset words, letters, and/or pictures that a user can point to, as well as things like notes. These require the person being communicated with to look at what is being expressed through the board/on the paper. To conserve space, symbols may mean different things in different context or have a meaning slightly longer than one word.

High-tech aided AAC communication devices are similar to low-tech boards, but digitized; they often speak aloud for the user and can have eye-tracking sensors, large joystick controls, or other ways for users to “point” if they do not have the muscular control to tap the screen.

No matter how someone communicates, remember to give them the respect and attention that they deserve. Quality or method of speech is not an indicator of quality of thought!
