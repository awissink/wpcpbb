**Harper Robbins**

This week's Feature Friday is Harper, our amazing President we could not have done without this year. Harper has been on the board for 3 years, serving as Friendship Walk Coordinator, Vice President, and President. She has also been matched with her buddy and best friend, Hannah, since freshman year. The two are an outstanding pair! Harper's dedication to the club is unmatched, her passion for inclusion goes above and beyond, and she will be missed so much next year. On her time in Best Buddies, Harper says, "I’ve loved being in Best Buddies for the past four years for so many reasons. Not only has it given me the opportunity to learn more about inclusion as I spread the message of acceptance around Payton and meet people from all over the world who are similarly passionate about IDD/VI advocacy, Best Buddies has allowed me to grow as a leader and as a person during my time at Payton. Best of all, it has allowed me to grow a friendship with Hannah, my Best Buddy and best friend, without whom I would have had a markedly less joyful, exciting, and fulfilling high school experience. As a member of the exec board and president of Best Buddies, I have loved being able to see the other friendships grow in the club and experience mission moments right alongside other pairs. Although I’m so sad to be leaving, I know next year’s board is going to do amazing things!" We can't wait to see what Harper accomplishes in the future, and we're already looking forward to when she visits us next! Thank you for everything you've done for the club!
