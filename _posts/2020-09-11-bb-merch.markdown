This summer, our Best Buddies chapter was named the 2019-2020 Chapter of the Year by Best Buddies International! It's a huge honor and we couldn't be more proud of each and every one of our members. Big shoutouts to Best Buddies Illinois, Payton and the Special Education department, and our community for being so supportive and allowing us to spread inclusion year after year!

To celebrate, we are hosting a fundraiser selling Chapter of the Year t-shirts! Shirts are $20 and all payments are to be made via Venmo (@Best-BuddiesWPCP). Please don't hesitate to reach out with any financial concerns â€” we want everyone to be able to order a shirt no matter the cost. That said, if you are able, donations are more than welcome.

Shirt orders are due September 18, 2020 (one week from today). Please use [THIS FORM](https://forms.gle/78ghDxQbWeZDuwcN9) to order a shirt.

We can't wait to see you all repping Payton Best Buddies!
