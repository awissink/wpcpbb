Across the world, assistive technology is helping to spread inclusion through varying classroom settings. In recent years, “the percentage of special needs students served in an inclusive setting is rising”, with many steps being made with the Individual Education Plans (IEP) of different students. Through these plans, educators are required to “adapt, make accommodations to, or adjust” educational materials in order to meet the needs of students. Scroll down to read about some of the devices that promote this inclusion!

**Braillers:** known as braille typewriters, these devices have keys which correspond to the different dots of braille code. In general, they can be used to take notes, but some include also calculators and address books, among other features.

**Talking Calculators:** calculators that can vocalize different actions. These calculators contain built in speech synthesizers that can read out different numbers, symbols, and answers, in addition to performing calculations.

**Phonetic Spelling Software:** software which automatically converts typing into the desired word by recognizing phonetic spelling.

**Variable Speed Tape Recorders:** Unlike some standard audio recorders, these ones allow for recordings to be sped up or slowed down, and for adjustment to audio pitch.
