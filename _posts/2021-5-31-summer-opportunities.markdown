Just because it’s summer doesn’t mean you have to stop being involved! Here is a list of summer opportunities to keep spreading inclusion:

- Camp SOAR: 2-week sleep away camp in Wisconsin for children and teens with IDD. Teens without IDD can apply to be a counselor [here](https://www.childrensresearchtriangle.org/camp-soar/)
- C.A.M.P: summer camp for children with physical disabilities. Learn more about volunteering [here](https://campchicago.weebly.com/)
- PALS Program: camp with both virtual and in person activities focussed on including people with Down Syndrome. Apply to be a volunteer [here](https://www.palsprograms.org/summer)

This list will be continually updated, so check back soon!
