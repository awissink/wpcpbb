Every year, Best buddies Walter Payton hosts an accessible prom for all Chicagoland high schools. The prom is put on entirely by the club, and as such is mostly DIY. This year, the theme is outer space and we can use as much help as we can get! The best ways you can help are:

- Donate your time and art skills: in the coming months, there will be a prom prep enrichment every Monday and Thursday. Come help us paper mache, paint, and design decorations!
- Give us your old paper: Have outdated newspaper? Finals study sheets you no longer need? That one test you never want to look at again? Drop them off in room 146 and we will use them for mod podge-ing planets!
- Loan us your lights: We need a LOT of white twinkle (Christmas) lights to pull off a ~starry sky~ look in the atrium! If your family has white light strands, please consider loaning them to us for prom! This will be closer to the day of (May 1)
- Pass on extra boxes: Amazon aficionado? We need a LOT of cardboard for the decorations, so any boxes (especially large ones!) would be greatly appreciated!
