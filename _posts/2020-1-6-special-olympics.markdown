Special Olympics and Best Buddies are often confused as being part of the same organization, because both aim to better the lives of people with IDD. However, the official mission statements do differ; while Special Olympics puts an emphasis on sports: 
"The mission of Special Olympics is to provide year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, giving them continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes and the community.” 
Best Buddies focuses on other aspects of life:
"Best Buddies is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).”
This year, Best Buddies and Special Olympics are working together to create the Spread the Word for Inclusion Movement, which is the modernized version of Spread the Word to End the Word. This collaboration is exciting, and it makes sense—did you know that Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of Special Olympics, is the mother of Best Buddies founder Anthony Kennedy Shriver?!?
Best Buddies and Special Olympics also work together at Payton. All of our friends in room 146 are Special Olympians in some sport, which gives us the great opportunity to create a connection between the two organizations every day! If you’re interested in getting involved in Special Olympics at Payton, you can sign up for the Unified Coaching Seminar, try out for the Unified Basketball Team (1/9/19), or reach out to out Sports Board President Ben Wilen at bcwilen@cps.edu
