We all know and love Paytonâ€™s therapy dog Bijou! She is always around to give a free hug, go for a walk, and make students feel better after a long day of tough school work. Bijou has helped every student and teacher in the building, but her presence is especially beneficial to our students with disabilities.

Studies have shown that therapy dogs like Bijou reduce feelings of anxiety, which is something people with autism (and other disabilities) can often feel in social situations. Having a dog by their side can help make social situations less intimidating and stress-inducing. They also are proven to help reduce aggression and negative behaviors.

In addition to the social/emotional benefits of having a therapy dog, studies have shown therapy dogs help improve reading, problem-solving, and memory skills. So the next time you see Bijou, make sure to let you know how much you appreciate her helping out our students!
