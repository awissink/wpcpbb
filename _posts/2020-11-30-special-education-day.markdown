This Wednesday will mark year 45 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) promoting inclusion within the classroom setting.  To begin with, we’ll learn a little bit about the history of the act before getting into its principles. The IDEA was signed into law by President Gerald Ford in 1975 and was a landmark civil rights action that “opened public school doors for millions of children with disabilities and laid the foundation of the country’s commitment to ensuring that children with disabilities have opportunities to develop their talents, share their gifts, and contribute to their communities.” Since its introduction, the act has gone through a series of amendments intended to make it all the more inclusive and equitable. As of yet, the act makes a free and appropriate education available to eligible children with disabilities across the country, and also provides additional special education supports and services. In addition, the act also authorizes “Formula grants to states to support special education and related services and early intervention services, as well as  Discretionary grants to state educational agencies, institutions of higher education, and other nonprofit organizations to support research, demonstrations, technical assistance and dissemination, technology development, personnel preparation and development, and parent-training and -information centers.”

Each year since 2005, December 2nd is honored as National Special Education Day due to the passing of the IDEA act on this date more than four decades ago. The celebration of National Special Education Day varies, but some people share under #SpecialEducationDay to talk about how IDEA has impacted their life or that of those around them, host luncheons, and send notes. Happy National Special Education Day!
