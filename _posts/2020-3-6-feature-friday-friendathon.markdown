This weekâ€™s feature Friday is everyone who attended our Friend-a-Thon, put on by Best Buddies Illinois. Not only did attendees get lots of cool swag (shirts, bracelets, stickers) for every fundraising milestone they reached, we also managed to hit over $1,000 in 24 hours! That is so amazing, and will go a long way for inclusion in Illinois. If you want to donate, participate, or help in any other way, reach out to our Major Events Coordinator (Lucy Zises) for more information on how to get involved!
