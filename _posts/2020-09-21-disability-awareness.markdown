Whether you are a new or returning member to Best Buddies, keeping some general norms in mind will ensure that everyone has a smooth and inclusive time during enrichment. In the coming weeks we’ll get more into disability awareness training, but as we transition back into enrichment space, here are some general things to keep in mind!

- Do not objectify or treat anyone like a younger child. You are talking to someone who is your age.
- Never use the R word, and make sure to call in those who do.
- Don’t change your voice. This includes baby talking and speaking much louder.
- Use person first language unless told by someone that they prefer otherwise when concerning themself. (Ex: Gracie has autism vs Gracie is autistic)
- Don’t refer to people without IDD as “normal,” “healthy,” or with similar adjectives in comparison to someone with an IDD.
- And as always, ask questions when you are unsure of something!
