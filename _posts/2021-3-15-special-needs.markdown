Many people still use the euphemism “special needs” to refer to disabled people but this term can be infantilizing and harmful to the disability community. In the video created by Coor Down called [“Not Special Needs”](https://youtu.be/kNMJaXuFuWQ), shown during advisory on March 3rd, they question what special needs people with disabilities actually have. Disabled people don’t need to be massaged by a cat or need to eat a dinosaur egg, two examples brought up in the video. These examples may seem extreme, but the point is that people with disabilities do not have needs different from non-disabled people. Everyone needs friends, education, food and all of the other basic necessities. Some of these needs may need to be met in ways different from someone without disabilities, but the need is still the same.

Many people feel afraid to use the word “disability” or “disabled” as if it was offensive or a bad word. This implies that being disabled makes someone less of a person and takes away from the experiences of disabled people. It is part of many disabled people’s identity and using words other than “disabled” takes away from who they are. Another reason using “disabled” is important is because of rights granted to disabled people because of The Americans with Disabilities act. Disabled is the term used in laws and using other terms can take away some of the rights and protections under these laws.

“Special” should only be used in terms of “special education” or “Special Olympics” and should be avoided when referring to a person. It is also important to remember that everyone has preferences in terms of what language they want you to use when referring to them. Some disabled people prefer you to use person first language, for example “person with autism” and others prefer to use identity first language, for example “autistic person”. Make sure to use the terms disabled people directly tell you they like to be referred to by or the terms they use to refer to themselves. It is not someone else’s place to decide how someone should identify themselves.
