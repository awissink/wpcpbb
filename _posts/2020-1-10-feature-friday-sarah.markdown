**Sarah & Christian**

Christian and Sarah are a new pair this year, and love to hang out during club meetings and Special Olympics activities. Sarah says, “I love Best Buddies and being paired with Christian because it gives us the opportunity to grow our friendship and make new friends. My favorite thing to do with Christian is to play tag and eat snacks. I am looking forward to the rest of the year and doing all kinds of fun activities. I admire how Christian is always in a good mood and is willing to try new things.” Christian also likes to spend time playing tag, and was very excited to share pizza and birthday cake on Friday!
