**Janiyah and Caitlin**

This week’s feature Friday is Janiyah and Caitlin, who were our January pair of the month! Today, they enjoyed a Domino’s lunch together. Says Caitlin of Best Buddies, “I love being a part of Best Buddies because I think being a part of a community as awesome as the Best Buddies community, where everyone is included and has fun, is really important. All the fun activities we participate in and all the new people I have gotten to meet through Best Buddies have made it a great experience. I enjoy being partnered with Janiyah because we really click. We both enjoy the same type of music and she always teaches me fun new dances to try out. It’s also really awesome to play basketball with Janiyah and just to participate in tons of fun activities with her.” Janiyah agrees, “I like being friends with Caitlin because she a good person.We have fun together in best buddies enrichment.” We can’t wait to see this friendship continue to blossom!
