Every year on March 21st marks a very special day to many. Since its inception in 2006, the March 21st celebration of World Down Syndrome Day has been known as a global awareness day, one which draws attention to what Down syndrome is, what it means to different people, and how those with Down syndrome ‘play a vital role in many communities’. 
World Down Syndrome Day (WDSD) is celebrated on March 21st to pay homage to the uniqueness of the triplication (March, the third month) of the 21st chromosome (21st day), which causes Down syndrome. Though the initiative was started in 2006, It took a few more years to be recognized by the United Nations in 2012.
Each year, different components of WDSD include global events, a conference at the United Nations headquarters, various calls to actions, WDSD awards, and even a #LotsOfSocks campaign. 

**UN Conference:** Each year’s conference in New York City entails a different theme, ranging from health and well being, to this year’s theme, “We Decide”. At each session, a variety of speakers from around the globe share their experiences with advocacy, professional lives, and more. In addition, other national agencies and nongovernmental agencies help contribute to the conference.   
**Awards:** Each year, awards are presented to individuals and groups who have worked to improve the lives of those with Down syndrome, through professional, scientific, or voluntary contributions. Some of this years group awards went to the Libya Down Syndrome Association, Ensemble Citoyens! of France, and Down Syndrome Association Turkey.  
**Lots of Socks:** World Down Syndrome Day’s yearly socks campaign includes that year’s new sock design, a design printed and sold on over 32,000 pairs of socks! In addition to the new sock design, the #LotsOfSocks tag is used to raise awareness around the world.  
**Calls to Action:** each yearly Call to Action is integrated in many WDSD activities. This year’s theme, “We Decide,” was chosen to highlight how “All people with Down syndrome should have full participation in decision making about matters relating to or affecting their lives.” This participation has been outlined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).  

**How Can I Get Involved Next Year?**
There are many ways to get involved! Getting involved can be as simple as wearing a fun pair of socks and posting to #LotsOfSocks, or can involve planning your own fundraiser around World Down Syndrome Day and its theme. You can also support by purchasing WDSD merchandise, and even by simply reading an article or watching a video to educate yourself and others.
