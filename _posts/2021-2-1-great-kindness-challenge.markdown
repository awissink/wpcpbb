Payton's students with disabilities are learning about the power of kindness. Every act of kindness matters, which is why we are asking students and faculty to participate in The Great Kindness Challenge! Please send in your daily acts of kindness either via [Google Form](https://forms.gle/sWU3Gj6dP1q8xqi2A) or by mailing/dropping off bright strips of paper with the acts written on them to a box outside of Payton. The students will turn these colorful strips into a chained work of art that grows with every submission and represents the kindness and love in our Payton community! Reach out to Ms. Spencer at skspencer@cps.edu with any questions!
