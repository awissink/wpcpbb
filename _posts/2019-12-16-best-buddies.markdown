The Best Buddies you know and love is a High School Friendship Chapter. But did you know that Best Buddies goes far beyond that? Friendships are also built in middle schools and colleges, between adults in the Citizens program, and online via e-Buddies.

In addition to friendships, Best Buddies also helps people with IDD find jobs. Did you know 81% if adults (people ages 18+) with IDD do not have a paid job in the community? And Best Buddies Jobs is special, because they actively work to make sure that the job is a good fit for the special skills of every individual, instead of just putting workers where its convenient. Do you know someone that owns a commons or business and is interested in hiring someone with an IDD? They can see which companies they would be joining the ranks with [here](https://www.bestbuddies.org/jobs/participating-employers/).

Best Buddies also supports people with and without IDD via Leadership Development, which helps them gain public speaking skills and confidence to advocate for themselves and for the Best Buddies mission in all sorts of settings, from their community to Congress. You can become a global ambassador, or volunteer as a speech trainer with BBLD!

The newest arm of Best Buddies is Living! The flagship location, just a few minutes from UCLA, opened this summer, and just hear what it includes: “The residence is located in Westwood, California only minutes away from the UCLA campus. It is a 5 bedroom/5 bathroom residence with 3 large communal areas, state of the art entertainment system, built-in barbeque, laundry area, 2-car garage, pool, and gorgeous back yard. Each room is full-furnished with its own bed, desk, nightstand, and TV. Located within minutes of shops, restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores in Westwood. Each resident will have their own room with a closet and bathroom.” All of it is incredibly well designed and absolutely gorgeous — so jealous!
