As our school year draws to a close, its important to remember that, especially during this time of social distancing, not having school can be very isolating for people with IDD. Although our last formal enrichment will be on June 12,  we encourage you to keep in contact with your friends from the club throughout the summer. If and when the governor and mayor begin to ease social distancing regulations, we encourage you to meet face-to-face with your buddies (if both of you are free of symptoms and feel comfortable doing so.) Should regulations allow, we will try to organize formal club get-togethers in the summer!
