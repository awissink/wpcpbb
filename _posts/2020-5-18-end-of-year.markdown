As this school year comes to an end, we want to thank you for your participation and support, as well as update you on events that will be happening throughout the end of this month and in June.

- Prom: A virtual Prom, hosted by Best Buddies Illinois, will take place on May 29. There will be a Zoom pre-party from 6:30-6:55 pm (hosted by Payton’s very own Harper!) followed by the dance from 7 to 8 pm. We hope to see you then!

- Final Enrichment/Virtual Cookout: Although we can’t be together for our annual end of year barbecue, our final enrichment on June 12th will be a cookout and awards ceremony as usual. Have a parent fire up the grill and be ready to celebrate a year of inclusion! Seniors welcome to attend.

- Friendship Walk: While the Chicago Friendship Walk was modified due to social distancing guidelines, it will still be occurring- online! This year’s virtual friendship walk will take place on June 20th, with nearly all states in the U.S. walking together! Tune in to the Best Buddies Illinois Facebook page at 10:15 AM to watch the opening ceremonies, then move to the Best Buddies International Facebook page or Instagram account to join Best Buddies founder Anthony Kennedy Shriver and some special celebrity guests as they walk for inclusion! Visit [https://www.bestbuddiesfriendshipwalk.org/chicago/event-details/]  for more information, and don’t forget—it’s not too late to raise $50 and earn a t-shirt!
