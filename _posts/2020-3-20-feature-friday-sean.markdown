**Sean and Ryan**

This week’s feature Friday is pair Sean and Ryan. Sean and Ryan were awarded pair of the month for February, for the growth they have shown in their friendship this past year. Of the club, Ryan says, “Best Buddies is an amazing organization that allows me to meet such amazing people and participate in many activities. Sean and I have fun in all of our activities and I've got to do new things through this match and Best Buddies, so I'm really happy about it. “  Sean says, “I love Best Buddies because I get to have fun and make new friends. I love being matched with a Ryan because he's my buddy and he's really nice.” What a great pair!
