**Danielle Anderson**

This week’s feature Friday is Danielle Anderson, who was chosen as our POD member of the month! Danielle leads the Parmm POD, and here’s what she had to say about being in Parmm this year: “I love being in a pod because each week I get to spend time bonding with a new buddy. Spending time with everyone in Best Buddies is definitely the highlight of my week. This year I am excited to strengthen friendships and for fun events like Best Buddies Prom!” Great work this month Danielle!
