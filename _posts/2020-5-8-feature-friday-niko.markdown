**Niko Vasilopoulos**

This week’s Feature Friday is Niko, our Vice President! 2019-2020 was Niko’s first year on the board, as well as his first year being matched with his buddy, Jamon. Next year, Niko will continue as VP while leading our student body as StudGov President! Way to go, Niko! About his position, Niko says, “Being Vice President means not only making sure events and enrichments go smoothly, but also ensuring that Peers and Pods are fostering friendships in every way possible. I have loved being VP this year, because I not only have gotten to bond closer with Jamon, but it has given me the opportunity to get closer with all the buddies, and members of our chapter.”
