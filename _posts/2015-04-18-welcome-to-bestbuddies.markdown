Welcome to the Walter Payton Best Buddies Club website! On this website, you can find our schedule, A and B associate groups, and a list of all peer buddy pairs.

We are also launching a fun new program: our blog! Stay tuned for more details, but this will be a club-wide operation that peer and associate members can participate in.

If you have any questions (or find any glitches/bugs on the new site!) feel free to email me at awissink@cps.edu.

Also, don't forget to donate to our [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/payton-best-buddies-yearly-expenses)!

Have a great Thanksgiving break!
