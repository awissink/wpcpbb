This week’s feature Friday is Karolina, a POD member in parmm. Karolina was nominated for her leadership in prom prep enrichments. About Best Buddies, she says, “I love Best buddies because the club has given me a community that I wouldn’t otherwise get to be part of. I have made friends and connections that have made my 4 years of high school so special. I look forward to Friday enrichments all week :)” Thank you for your dedication Karolina!
