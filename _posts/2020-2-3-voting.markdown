Tonight is the Iowa Caucus, a major event that will set the tone for the upcoming 2020 election. But if you take time to consider the method by which caucuses are run—voters showing up to a location, needing to stay until a voting is decided, and moving around different parts of the room—you can see how differently abled people, especially those with physical disabilities may be at a disadvantage when it comes to having their voice heard. In the official election, differently abled people face more barriers, too; lack of parking, large crowds, long waits, and arbitrary ID and mental health laws are inconveniences for everybody, but can completely stop a person with IDD from being able to vote. Another barrier is that many citizens completely capable of voting lose their right to vote during the conservatorship process. The majority of U.S. states allow judges to strip voting rights from people with anything from schizophrenia to Down syndrome, should they deem them “incapacitated.” Luckily, Illinois is not one such state.
