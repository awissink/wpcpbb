We’ve spent the past few weeks learning all about inclusion in the workplace. We’ve learned about gaps in employment for those with disabilities and how different organizations are working to bridge those gaps However, inequities don’t stop when one is actually hired for a job. According to the Equality and human rights commission (EHRC), between 1997-2014 the disability pay gap was 13% for men and 7% for women. Additionally, studies have found that those with disabilities are more likely to be in poverty, although the extent to which may vary. Even across those who are employed with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), disparities exist among different groups. For example, those with learning disabilities tend to have a 60% pay gap while those with physical disabilities experience a 15-28% gap, with variations depending on the nature of their disability. In addition to pay gaps existing and varying for those with different abilities, other factors such as race and gender can widen existing gaps. In addition to base pay being lower for those with disabilities, which is legal in many areas, those with disabilities are more likely to work part time jobs than full time, which pay less on average.

While these gaps exist, different groups and organizations are working to bridge them, in their fight for a more inclusive world. In the United States,  “A bipartisan effort – the Transformation to Competitive Employment Act – was introduced that aims to bring an end to “sub-minimum” wages for disabled people. Section 14 (c) of the 80-year-old Fair Labor Standards Act permits employers who receive a certificate from the Department of Labor to pay such low wages. The TCEA, introduced by the Democrats, Senator Bob Casey and Congressman Bobby Scott along with Republican representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers , proposes phasing this out within six years. (There have been repeated efforts at a federal level to eliminate the exemption, and sub-minimum wages are already banned in some states.)”
